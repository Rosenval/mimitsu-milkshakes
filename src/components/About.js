            <p>I came up with the idea of Mimitsu Milkshakes in my dreams. I mean, <span className="italic">literally</span> in my dreams. One night I dreamt
                about opening my own Milkshake Bar, ideally a cozy place with <a href="https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/things-to-do/dining/mels-drive-in" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="italic">Mel's Drive-In</a> vibes
                but way smaller, with pastel colors (mostly pink) mainly serving
                milkshakes/fresh drinks (idk, I'm not even THAT obsessed with milkshakes
                nor do I aim to open any kind of bar or cafe but whateverrr this somehow made sense in dreams).
                When I woke up, I wondered what name I could possibly give to this imaginary bar and
                immediatly came up with "Mimitsu Milkshakes": the first "Mi" in "Mimitsu" stands
                for "Mia" (me) while "Mitsu" for "Mitsuha" aka one of the main characters of Shinkai's movie
                <span className="italic">"Your Name."</span>, my favorite movie of his and it just so happens
                that it's all about... <span className="bold italic">dreams </span><span className="sbarrato">(well it's deeper that
                but we're not gonna focus on that here)</span>. The movie's visuals are insane and
                convey a sense of peace (although the story gets pretty sad and tear-jerker at some point): so,
                the goal of the website is indeed to recreate that peacefulness and the idea of a welcoming place where to feel
                comfortable, carefree and - why not - at home. Since I won't open a real Mimitsu Milkshakes irl (sadge)
                but it over time has become a meme between me & my friends, I decided to keep the idea alive by putting my imagination into my
                front-end development project(s), so that on one hand I practice whilst having fun and on the other hand also have the
                chance to make it very personal and concrete (as concrete as it can be aha) who knows, maybe someday someone will decide to start their
                Mimitsu Milkshakes business and guess what? They'll have one page of the website ready! You never know &#9825;<br/><br/>
